<h1>1.3 Storage Drives</h1>
<p>A computer drive is a piece of hardware that is used toreadandstore information
on the computer and that is usually not as easily removed as a disk. For example,
in Microsoft windows, users can identify the drives windows has detected by
opening file explorer (right-clicking on windows icon on the taskbar), opening
This PC icon on the desktop, or pressing the windows key + E.</p>

<p>
  Whenever someone saves his/her file on the computer, it simply means that
the file is stored on the hard disk. Currently, there are other ways of saving files
using cloud-based drives. OneDrive and google drive are examples of cloudbased drives on which files are stored. You should consider the following important points about drives.</P>
<ol><ul> Each drive is assigned a letter to identify it.</ul><br>
<ul>The letter identifies the root of the file where it is originated from (this
means, the location where the file was saved in).</ul></ol>
<h3>Drives and Drive Letters</h3>
<p>A drive is alternatively referred to as a device letter. A drive letter is a single alphabetic character A through Z that is assigned to a physical computer drive or
drive partition. For example, a computer with a 3 1/2‚Äù floppy diskette drive has a
drive letter of A: assigned to the drive. Computers containing a hard drive always
have that default hard drive assigned to C: drive letter, and CD-ROM or another
disc drive, which is the last drive letter (For example E:). Figure 1.3 shows devices
and drives.</p>
