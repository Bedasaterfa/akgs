<h1>1.2 File Management</h1>
<p>
Brainstorming
1. How are files handled at your home?
2. Can you describe ways of managing files in school or other organizations?.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of automation system, schools and other societies used
to manage and organize their sensitive data in traditional file systems such filing
cabinets. Such systems are so traditional and complicated to access files.
Figure 1.1 shows a filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Nowadays, to recognize file management, you need to understand how your computer stores information. A file is the common storage unit in a computer, and all
programs and data are “written” into and “read” from the file. </p>
<p>Computers store information in files which are also organized and grouped
in folders and stored on disks, not in big drawers. Computers rely on hard disk
drives (HDDs) to store data permanently. They are storage devices used to save
and retrieve digital information that will be required for future reference.</p>
<p><b>A disk drive</b> is a technology that enables the reading, writing, deleting and
modifying of data on a computer storage disk. It is either a built-in or external component of a disk that manages the disk’s input/output (I/O) operations. The most
common type of disk drive is a hard disk drive (HDD), and the terms<i> disk drive </i>and
<i>hard disk drive</i> are typically used interchangeably. Other types of hard disc include
optical drives, storage devices and floppy drives. Figure 1.2 shows a disk drive</p>
